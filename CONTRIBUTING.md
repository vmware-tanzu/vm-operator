# Contributing to VM Operator

It's still early days for VM Operator, but we would love to connect with people who are as passionate about Kubernetes and Virtual Machines as we are!

Please raise issues and feel free to open PRs.

Any suggestions on usability, readability, clarity or architecture are all welcome.

We will be building out the roadmap and starting a weekly design meeting soon!
