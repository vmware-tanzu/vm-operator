                  Memory represents whether the snapshot includes the VM's
                  memory. If true, a dump of the internal state of the virtual
                  machine (a memory dump) is included in the snapshot. Memory
                  snapshots consume time and resources and thus, take longer to
                  create.
                  The virtual machine must support this capability.
                  When set to false, the power state of the snapshot is set to
                  false.
                  For a VM in suspended state, memory is always included

                  is powered on when the snapshot is taken, VMware Tools is used
                  to quiesce the file system in the virtual machine. This assures
                  that a disk snapshot represents a consistent state of the guest
                  file systems. If the virtual machine is powered off or VMware
                  Tools are not available, the quiesce spec is ignored.
