// CNSAttachmentNameForVolume returns the name of the CnsNodeVmAttachment based
// on the VM and Volume name.
// This matches the naming used in previous code but there are situations where
// we may get a collision between VMs and Volume names. I'm not sure if there is
// an absolute way to avoid that: the same situation can happen with the
// claimName.
// Ideally, we would use GenerateName, but we lack the back-linkage to match
// Volumes and CnsNodeVmAttachment up.
// The VM webhook validate that this result will be a valid k8s name.
