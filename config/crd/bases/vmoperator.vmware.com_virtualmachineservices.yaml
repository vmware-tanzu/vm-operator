      description: VirtualMachineService is the Schema for the virtualmachineservices
        API. A VirtualMachineService represents the desired specification and the
        observed status of a VirtualMachineService instance.  A VirtualMachineService
        represents a network service, provided by one or more VirtualMachines, that
        is desired to be exposed to other workloads both internal and external to
        the cluster.

          description: VirtualMachineServiceSpec defines the desired state of VirtualMachineService.  Each
            VirtualMachineService exposes a set of TargetPorts on a set of VirtualMachine
            instances as a network endpoint within or outside of the Kubernetes cluster.  The
            VirtualMachineService is loosely coupled to the VirtualMachines that are
            backing it through the use of a Label Selector.  In Kubernetes, a Label
            Selector enables matching of a resource using a set of key-value pairs,
            aka Labels.  By using a Label Selector, the VirtualMachineService can
            be generically defined to apply to any VirtualMachine that has the appropriate
            set of labels.
