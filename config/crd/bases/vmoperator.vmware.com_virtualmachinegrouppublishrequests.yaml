              VirtualMachineGroupPublishRequestSpec defines the desired state of a
              VirtualMachineGroupPublishRequest.

              All the fields in this spec are optional. This is especially useful when a
              DevOps persona wants to publish a VM Group without doing anything more than
              applying a VirtualMachineGroupPublishRequest resource that has the same name
              as said VMs in the same namespace as said VMs in VM Group.

              source:
                description: |-
                  Source is the name of the VirtualMachineGroup to be published.

                  If this value is omitted then the publication controller checks to
                  see if there is a VirtualMachineGroup with the same name as this
                  VirtualMachineGroupPublishRequest resource. If such a resource exists,
                  then it is the source of the publication.

                  Target is the name of the ContentLibrary resource to which the
                  VirtualMachines from the VirtualMachineGroup should be published.

                  When this value is omitted, the controller attempts to identify the
                  target location by matching a ContentLibrary resource with the label
                  "imageregistry.vmware.com/default".

                  Please note that while optional, if a VirtualMachineGroupPublishRequest
                  sans target information is applied to a namespace without a default
                  publication target, then the VirtualMachineGroupPublishRequest resource
                  will be marked in error.

                  completes. After the TTL expires, the resource will be automatically
                  deleted without the user having to take any direct action.
                  This will be passed into each VirtualMachinePublishRequestSpec.

                  If this field is unset then the request resource will not be
                  automatically deleted. If this field is set to zero then the request
                  resource is eligible for deletion immediately after it finishes.
